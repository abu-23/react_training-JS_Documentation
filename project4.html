                <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                    is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                    example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                      Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                      to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                      client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                      HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                      and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                      relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                      extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                      provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                      the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but 
                    does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and 
                    basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad 
                    and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: 
                </p>
                <code
                >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
              </code>
              <p>
                Select the code in the pad and hit
                 Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
